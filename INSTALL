 To install the OpenGL module, please follow these instructions:
 
 1. Edit Makefile.PL, and comment out any packages that your system
    doesn't have. (If you are using Mesa 3.0 or later, then you definitely
    have all of them.) If you are unsure, leave them all enabled
    and try building the package.
    
    You may also need to fix up the list of library paths and names.
 
 2. Run 'perl Makefile.PL'
 
 3. Run 'make'
 
 4. If your system has GLUT available, you can run 'make test' to make sure
    everything is functioning properly.
 
 5. If all is well, run 'make install' to make the OpenGL module available
    to your system.
