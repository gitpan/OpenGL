Perl 5.10 and GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object extention

Using the VBO extension causes a crash in Perl 5.10 - this is
possibly due to how memory is managed in 5.10, and is triggered
when OpenGL moves VBO data to/from the GPU via DMA.

We are in the process of determining whether this can be worked
around in POGL, or will need to be fixed in Perl 5.10
A fix will be posted as soon as one can be found.
