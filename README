OpenGL Module Overview
----------------------

OpenGL is a standard API for doing computer graphics. This module allows a
perl program to use OpenGL by letting it make OpenGL function calls.

What's Here
-----------
This module basically has all of the opengl library and some of the X, glu
and glx libraries. In addition, some extra routines are provided for
convienience. For example, "glpOpenWindow", does all that X/glX setup stuff
for you.

The perl module preserves the interface (names and arguments) to all the
opengl functions. Therefore, you can continue to use existing man pages,
books, and other documentation.

System Requirements
-------------------
Obviously you need a machine with Perl 5. If you dont have perl5, and you
have an SGI then get it here. You also must have either:

   * OpenGL and X (with the glx extention)
   * MesaGL library, which is compatable software implementation of OpenGL.

This module has only been tested on a SGI workstation running IRIX 5.3 and
using PERL version 5.001 Unofficial patchlevel 1m. I'm told that it works
great on AIX 3.2.5 too, and with Mesa on SunOS.

More Info
