If you have any problems building the module, installing, or running demos,
then see the file "HELP", or get the most up-to-date help at

        http://www.arc.ab.ca/vr/opengl/help.html


Getting the Software
--------------------
The software can be ftp'd from:
	ftp://skyler.arc.ab.ca/pub/perl
Snag the file OpenGL-0.4.tar.gz . Its the most recent version. Unless, of
course, you see a later version :-) Note that this is still considered an
alpha release.

Now gunzip and untar the file:
        gunzip -c OpenGL-0.4.tar.gz | tar xvf -
Go into the newly created "OpenGL-0.4" directory:
        cd OpenGL

Have a look over the contents and some of the files including the README.
You are now ready to build the module.

Building the Module
-------------------
To generate the Makefile do a:

        perl Makefile.PL

This generates the Makefile. If you have to configure something, do it in
Makefile.PL if possible. Next, simply do a

        make

and hopefully everything works smoothly. Remember to look at HELP if there
are problems.

There are a number of example programs in the examples directory. Some of
them are perl versions of the samples used in the "OpenGL Programming Guide"
published by Addison-Wesley. Test the install with some of these programs
You may have to change the first line

        #!/usr/local/bin/perl

to whatever the pathname for perl is. i.e.:

        cd examples
        perl -pi -e "s,/usr/local/bin/perl,`which perl`,;" *

(No promises that the above line will work correctly.) Enjoy.

If you get things working then be sure to do the following:

        echo "Yo, the OpenGL module works!" | mail stan@arc.ab.ca

Try doing some stuff on your own. You may find the tutorial helpful.

If you want to build the Netscape plugin then go to the plugins subdirectory!

Installation
------------
If you have the necessary permission then you can install the OpenGL module
in the perl library. If you're in the examples directory then get back out
("cd .."). Do a:

        make install

If there are no problems then everything should install correctly. Test the
examples using the installed module (dont have the demo search the "blib"
directory by commenting out the appropriate line):

        cd examples
        perl -pi -e 's/^(BEGIN.*unshift.*INC)/\#$1/;' *
