This is the refactored Perl OpenGL module (POGL) based on work
integrating in PDL.  The pogl branch has been started to expedite
the back port and integration with PDL of the new OpenGL binding
and to verify that OpenGL::Image or OpenGL::Shader have not been
broken inadvertently.

PDL::Graphics::OpenGL::Perl::OpenGL is a development version of the
Perl OpenGL (POGL) module for the purposes of evaluating the implementation
for the Perl Data Language integration.  This version is based on
0.57 POGL.  The features developer in this module will be folded into
the OpenGL software at which point this release sequence will be
superceded by that module.

See the OpenGL module if you need Perl OpenGL bindings.  Thanks.
