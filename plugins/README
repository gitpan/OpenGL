You may need to get the latest version of
netscape that supports unix plugins:

        ftp://ftp1.netscape.com/sdk/unix/

You may wish to get the most recent version of perl and install it.
Version 5.002 gamma or greater is recommended.
You need to have the Safe module (included in 5.002).  You can get it at:

	ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/lang/perl/CPAN/authors/id/ANDYD/

Use the makefile that is appropriate for your system.
for example:

	cp makefile.sgi Makefile

execute the command:

	make

That will build the plugin shared object libopenglplugin.so .
To have netscape find the plugin install it:

	cp libopenglplugin.so /usr/local/lib/netscape/plugins/libopenglplugin.so

or set the environment variable NPX_PLUGIN_PATH to the directory that
contains libopenglplugin.so.  For example (csh users):

	setenv NPX_PLUGIN_PATH $HOME/OpenGL-0.4/plugin

or for bash users:

	export NPX_PLUGIN_PATH=$HOME/OpenGL-0.4/plugin/

If the Opengl perl module is installed you can run netscape from any directory:

	netscape http://www.arc.ab.ca/vr/opengl/plugin.html

If the OpenGL perl module is built but not installed (via 'make install') then
you must run netscape from the OpenGL-?.? directory or one level below it
such as this directory.

The MIME type is:
	application/perl-opengl
and the file extention (for things in local file space) is:
	.glp

To put your opengl programs on your web page you may have to add the line
	AddType application/perl-opengl .glp
to the .htaccess file in the same directory (this depends on your http server).

Note that not all opengl programs will be able to run.
The plugin executes code in a "safe" manner which forbids
any potentially bad things from happening.

I make no promises or guarantees of this software.
I have only tested this on an SGI workstation so far.

But feel free to send any flames comments or questions you may have to:

thanks
